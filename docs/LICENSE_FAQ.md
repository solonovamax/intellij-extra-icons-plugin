## How to get a lifetime license?

2023/11/30: JetBrains will introduce a new business model for paid/freemium plugins. This model will offer a perpetual license, **allowing users to make a one-time payment for the plugin and use it for a lifetime** (which is different from the traditional *perpetual* license offered after 12 months of uninterrupted subscription). **There is no ETA from JetBrains yet**.  
I will publish a **separate version** of Extra Icons with lifetime licenses, simply because the marketplace can't maintain two license types simultaneously for the same plugin. I will give more information asap, like the price of this lifetime license, and the name of this special version of Extra Icons plugin. This will be the exact same plugin (same codebase, simply a build with a different plugin name) with the same icons, the same functionalities, the same release dates and support, and the same GitHub repository, but with a lifetime license instead of a yearly/monthly subscription.    
Extra Icons plugin will show a notification in your IDE when the lifetime license becomes available for purchase.  
Please note this separate plugin will use the same configuration files as the regular Extra Icons plugin, which means you won't lose your preferences and user icons.

2023/11/30: JetBrains 将为付费/免费插件引入新的商业模式. 这种模式将提供永久许可证，**允许用户一次性支付插件费用并终身使用**（这与传统的不间断订购 12 个月后提供的*永久*许可证不同）.  
我将发布一个**单独版本**的 Extra Icons，并提供终身许可证，原因很简单，因为市场无法同时为同一个插件提供两种许可证类型. 我将尽快提供更多信息，如终身许可证的价格以及 Extra Icons 插件特殊版本的名称. 这将是一个完全相同的插件（代码库相同，只是构建时使用了不同的插件名称），具有相同的图标、相同的功能、相同的发布日期和支持，以及相同的 GitHub 存储库，但使用的是终身许可，而不是按年/月订阅.  
当您可以购买终身许可证时，Extra Icons 插件会在您的集成开发环境中显示通知.  
请注意，此独立插件将使用与常规 Extra Icons 插件相同的配置文件，这意味着您不会丢失首选项和用户图标.

## How to get a perpetual fallback license?

As explained on the JetBrains marketplace, 12 months of uninterrupted subscription payments qualify you for receiving a [perpetual fallback license (details here)](https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207240845-What-is-perpetual-fallback-license). Please note this is NOT a lifetime license.

## I am a student or a teacher, can I get a license for free?

I no longer offer licenses to students and teachers.

Meanwhile, if you contributed to Extra Icons, please email me, or send a private message on Twitter (JLermitage): I have some coupons for free licenses for you.

## I am an OSS developer, can I get a license for free?

I no longer offer licenses to OSS developer. Too many cheaters.

## I received a coupon for a free license, how does it work?

Please note a coupon is not an activation code, it's a bit weird. You need to hit the "Buy" button (monthly or yearly subscription, it doesn't matter), then enter the coupon code. The form will now say you will get a 9-months license at no cost.  
You can activate your coupons when you want, they have no expiration date.

## Will we have to pay for your [other plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/author/ed9cc7eb-74f5-46c1-b0df-67162fe1a1c5)?

I have no plan for that. I now have supporters thanks to the Extra Icons project, and I am super happy with that. I don't provide OSS to make money. I may create new paid plugins, but my existing free plugins (as of Dec. 2023: [Extra ToolWindow Colorful Icons](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16604-extra-toolwindow-colorful-icons/), [Icon Viewer 2](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13995-icon-viewer-2/), [Darcula Sombre](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12264-darcula-sombre/), [Battery Status](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12321-battery-status/), [I Love DevToys](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20198-i-love-devtoys/), [Night and Day](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16550-night-and-day/) and [World Clock](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17816-world-clock/)) will remain totally free forever, even on the marketplace. Feel free to support my work.

## Why a paid plugin?

The funding of OSS is a big question and, unfortunately, I think we can't discuss this on the Internet. I tried, but had to deal with the extreme aggressiveness of some toxic users. It was a very disturbing experience. Some people have no inhibition on the Internet. I think they are a minority, but they are very loud. Additionally, some idiots organized a review-bombing against all my plugins (JetBrains moderators took some time to delete those toxic reviews, thx for their help).

To answer the question quickly, I am doing free and OSS since ~2010. I started on Sourceforge.net with some Java libraries and NetBeans plugins. Like many contributors, I am doing this for fun, to share and learn interesting things. Also, like many contributors, motivation varies over time, and I tried many things (including donations and sponsorship) but it simply doesn't work. Now, I am looking for a minimal recognition. Some people don't need this, but this is their own mentality, their own vision of OSS, and I think we should respect each other. That's why I am now asking for a modest financial contribution. Technically, I had to pick one of my projects, I think the most useful, and one of the projects that represents the highest number of work hours. That's why I don't (and won't) ask for a financial contribution for my other OSS projects. I now have supporters, and I am super happy with that. I want to work with supporters, not for customers.
