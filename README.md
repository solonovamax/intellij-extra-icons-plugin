Intellij IDEA (Community and Ultimate) plugin that adds icons for files like Travis YML, Appveyor YML, Git sub-modules, etc.  
You can also register your own icons in order to override file icons, but also all [IDE icons](https://jetbrains.design/intellij/resources/icons_list/) (including toolbars, menus, etc.). It works with all JetBrains products like IntelliJ (ultimate and community), PyCharm, WebStorm, DataGrip, etc.  
To get started with this plugin, please see this [guide](docs/GET_STARTED.md).

## Download

Download plugin from the [JetBrains marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11058-extra-icons) or via your IDE: <kbd>File</kbd>, <kbd>Settings...</kbd>, <kbd>Plugins</kbd>, <kbd>Marketplace</kbd>.

## Build

Install a JDK17+. You should be able to start Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`).  
Take a look at the `Makefile` script: it contains useful commands to build, run and test the plugin, check for dependencies updates and some maintenance tasks. Show available commands by running `make help`.  
You may also want to see the [development FAQ](./docs/DEV_FAQ.md) if you faced an issue.

### Optimizations

Optionally, you may want to install SVGO in order to optimize SVG icons. Install SVGO with `npm install -g svgo`, then optimize SVG files by running `make svgo`.

## How to contribute

Please see [CONTRIBUTION.md](CONTRIBUTION.md).

Nota: you can test icons with this [sample project](https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/intellij-extra-icons-plugin/tree/sample-project). This is a project with many empty files. It will help you to verify icon overrides.
